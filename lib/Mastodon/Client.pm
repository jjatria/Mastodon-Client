Mastodon::Client - Talk to a Mastodon server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mastodon::Client;

  my $client = Mastodon::Client->new(
    instance        => 'mastodon.social',
    name            => 'PerlBot',
    client_id       => $client_id,
    client_secret   => $client_secret,
    access_token    => $access_token,
    coerce_entities => 1,
  );

  $client->post_status('Posted to a Mastodon server!');
  $client->post_status('And now in secret...',
    { visibility => 'unlisted' }
  )

  # Streaming interface might change!
  my $listener = $client->stream( 'public' );
  $listener->on( update => sub {
    my ($listener, $status) = @_;
    printf "%s said: %s\n",
      $status->account->display_name,
      $status->content;
  });
  $listener->start;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mastodon::Client lets you talk to a Mastodon server to obtain authentication
credentials, read posts from timelines in both static or streaming mode, and
perform all the other operations exposed by the Mastodon API.

Most of these are available through the convenience methods listed below, which
validate input parameters and are likely to provide more meaningful feedback in
case of errors.

Alternatively, this distribution can be used via the low-level request methods
(B<post>, B<get>, etc), which allow direct access to the API endpoints. All
other methods call one of these at some point.

=head1 VERSION NOTICE

This distribution currently B<only supports version 1 of the Mastodon API>.

Help implementing support for any missing features in version 1, and for the
new features in version 2, would be greatfully appreciated.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item B<instance>

A Mastodon::Entity::Instance object representing the instance to which this
client will speak. Defaults to C<mastodon.social>.

=item B<api_version>

An integer specifying the version of the API endpoints to use. Defaults to C<1>.

=item B<redirect_uri>

The URI to which authorization codes should be forwarded as part of the OAuth2
flow. Defaults to C<urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob> (meaning no redirection).

=item B<user_agent>

The user agent to use for the requests. Defaults to an instance of
L<HTTP::Thin>. It is expected to have a C<request> method that
accepts L<HTTP::Request> objects.

=item B<coerce_entities>

A boolean value. Set to true if you want Mastodon::Client to internally coerce
all response entities to objects. This adds a level of validation, and can
make the objects easier to use.

Although this does require some additional processing, the coercion is done by
L<Type::Tiny>, so the impact is negligible.

For now, it defaults to B<false> (but this will likely change, so I recommend
you use it).

=item B<access_token>

The access token of your client. This is provided by the Mastodon API and is
used for the OAuth2 authentication required for most API calls.

You can get this by calling B<authorize> with either an access code or your
account's username and password.

=item B<authorized>

Boolean. False is the client has no defined access_token. When an access token
is set, this is set to true or to a L<DateTime> object representing the time of
authorization if possible (as received from the server).

=item B<client_id>

=item B<client_secret>

The client ID and secret are provided by the Mastodon API when you register
your client using the B<register> method. They are used to identify where your
calls are coming from, and are required before you can use the B<authorize>
method to get the access token.

=item B<name>

Your client's name. This is required when registering, but is otherwise seldom
used. If you are using the B<authorization_url> to get an access code from your
users, then they will see this name when they go to that page.

=item B<account>

Holds the authenticated account. It is set internally by the B<get_account>
method.

=item B<scopes>

This array reference holds the scopes set by you for the client. These are
required when registering your client with the Mastodon instance. Defaults to
C<read>.

Mastodon::Client will internally make sure that the scopes you were provided
when calling B<authorize> match those that you requested. If this is not the
case, it will helpfully die.

=item B<website>

The URL of a human-readable website for the client. If made available, it
appears as a link in the "authorized applications" tab of the user preferences
in the default Mastodon web GUI. Defaults to the empty string.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Authorizing an application

Although not all of the API methods require authentication to be used, most of
them do. The authentication process involves a) registering an application with
a Mastodon server to obtain a client secret and ID; b) authorizing the
application by either providing a user's credentials, or by using an
authentication URL.

The methods facilitating this process are detailed below:

=over 4

=item B<register()>

=item B<register(%data)>

Obtain a client secret and ID from a given mastodon instance. Takes a single
hash as an argument, with the following possible keys:

=over 4

=item B<redirect_uris>

The URL to which authorization codes should be forwarded after authorized by
the user. Defaults to the value of the B<redirect_uri> attribute.

=item B<scopes>

The scopes requested by this client. Defaults to the value of the B<scopes>
attribute.

=item B<website>

The client's website. Defaults to the value of the C<website> attribute.

=back

When successful, sets the C<client_secret>, C<scopes>, and C<client_id>
attributes of the Mastodon::Client object and returns the modified object.

This should be called B<once> per client and its contents cached locally.

=item B<authorization_url()>

Generate an authorization URL for the given application. Accessing this URL
via a browser by a logged in user will allow that user to grant this
application access to the requested scopes. The scopes used are the ones in the
B<scopes> attribute at the time this method is called.

=item B<authorize()>

=item B<authorize( %data )>

Grant the application access to the requested scopes for a given user. This
method takes a hash with either an access code or a user's login credentials to
grant authorization. Valid keys are:

=over 4

=item B<access_code>

The access code obtained by visiting the URL generated by B<authorization_url>.

=item B<username>

=item B<password>

The user's login credentials.

=back

When successful, the method automatically sets the client's B<authorized>
attribute to a true value and caches the B<access_token> for all future calls.

=back

=head2 Error handling

Methods that make requests to the server will C<die> whenever an error is
encountered, or the data that was received from the server is not what is
expected. The error string will, when possible, come from the response's
status line, but this will likely not be enough to fully diagnose what
went wrong.

=over 4

=item B<latest_response>

To make this easier, the client will cache the server's response after each
request has been made, and expose it through the C<latest_response> accessor.

Note that, as its name implies, I<this will only store the most recent
response>.

If called before any request has been made, it will return an undefined
value.

=back

The remaining methods listed here follow the order of those in the official API
documentation.

=head2 Accounts

=over 4

=item B<get_account()>

=item B<get_account($id)>

=item B<get_account($params)>

=item B<get_account($id, $params)>

Fetches an account by ID. If no ID is provided, this defaults to the current
authenticated account. Global GET parameters are available for this method.

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, it returns a
Mastodon::Entity::Account object, or a plain hash reference.

=item B<update_account($params)>

Make changes to the authenticated account. Takes a hash reference with the
following possible keys:

=over 4

=item B<display_name>

=item B<note>

Strings

=item B<avatar>

=item B<header>

A base64 encoded image, or the name of a file to be encoded.

=back

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, returns the modified
Mastodon::Entity::Account object, or a plain hash reference.

=item B<followers()>

=item B<followers($id)>

=item B<followers($params)>

=item B<followers($id, $params)>

Get the list of followers of an account by ID. If no ID is provided, the one
for the current authenticated account is used. Global GET parameters are
available for this method.

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, returns an array reference of
Mastodon::Entity::Account objects, or a plain array reference.

=item B<following()>

=item B<following($id)>

=item B<following($params)>

=item B<following($id, $params)>

Get the list of accounts followed by the account specified by ID. If no ID is
provided, the one for the current authenticated account is used. Global GET
parameters are available for this method.

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, returns an array reference of
Mastodon::Entity::Account objects, or a plain array reference.

=item B<statuses()>

=item B<statuses($id)>

=item B<statuses($params)>

=item B<statuses($id, $params)>

Get a list of statuses from the account specified by ID. If no ID is
provided, the one for the current authenticated account is used.

In addition to the global GET parameters, this method accepts the following
parameters:

=over 4

=item B<only_media>

=item B<exclude_replies>

Both boolean.

=back

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, returns an array reference of
Mastodon::Entity::Status objects, or a plain array reference.

=item B<follow($id)>

=item B<unfollow($id)>

Follow or unfollow an account specified by ID. The ID argument is mandatory.

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, returns the new
Mastodon::Entity::Relationship object, or a plain hash reference.

=item B<block($id)>

=item B<unblock($id)>

Block or unblock an account specified by ID. The ID argument is mandatory.

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, returns the new
Mastodon::Entity::Relationship object, or a plain hash reference.

=item B<mute($id)>

=item B<unmute($id)>

Mute or unmute an account specified by ID. The ID argument is mandatory.

Depending on the value of C<coerce_entities>, returns the new
Mastodon::Entity::Relationship object, or a plain hash reference.

=item B<relationships(@ids)>

=item B<relationships(@ids, $params)>

Get the list of relationships of the current authenticated user with the
accounts specified by ID. At least one ID is required, but more can be passed
at once. Global GET parameters are available for this method, and can be passed
as an additional hash reference as a final argument.

Creates a Mastodon::Listener object which will fetch a stream for the
specified query. Possible values for the query are either C<user>, for events
that are relevant to the authorized user; C<public>, for all public statuses;
or a tag (if it begins with the C<#> character), for all public statuses for
the particular tag.

For more details on how to use this object, see the documentation for
L<Mastodon::Listener>.

Accessing streaming public timeline does not require authentication.

=back

=head1 REQUEST METHODS

Mastodon::Client uses four lower-level request methods to contact the API
with GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. These are left available in case
one of the higher-level convenience methods are unsuitable or undesirable, but
you use them at your own risk.

They all take a URL as their first parameter, which can be a string with the
API endpoint to contact, or a L<URI> object, which will be used as-is.

If passed as a string, the methods expect one that contains only the variable
parts of the endpoint (ie. not including the C<HOST/api/v1> part). The
remaining parts will be filled-in appropriately internally.

=over 4

=item B<delete($url)>

=item B<get($url)>

=item B<get($url, $params)>

Query parameters can be passed as part of the L<URI> object, but it is not
recommended you do so, since Mastodon has expectations for array parameters
that do not meet those of eg. L<URI::QueryParam>. It will be easier and safer
if any additional parameters are passed as a hash reference, which will be
added to the URL before the request is sent.

=item B<post($url)>

=item B<post($url, $data)>

=item B<patch($url)>

=item B<patch($url, $data)>

the C<post> and C<patch> methods work similarly to C<get> and C<delete>, but
the optional hash reference is sent in as form data, instead of processed as
query parameters. The Mastodon API does not use query parameters on POST or
PATCH endpoints.
