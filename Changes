Revision history for Mastodon::Client

0.015     2018-04-22 02:36:42+01:00 Europe/London

  * New:
    * Status entities now have a placeholder `emojis` attribute.
      This will likely need to be populated with a new entity.
  * Changes:
    * A successful call to `register` will overwrite the value
      of the client's `scopes` attribute to that passed as an
      argument (since those are the scopes that were requested
      from the server; thanks Shura0!).
  * Fixes:
    * Fixed an issue with authorisation of clients that used
      scopes other than `read` (thanks Shura0!)
    * Corrected an error in the documentation that stated that
      `register` accepted a hash reference instead of a hash.
    * Coercing attachment entities without `remote_url`s no longer
      results in an error.
